# Happify or FEEL-GOOD

## Description
This website has different options to help people feel good.

## How to run the app
To run website, in command prompt, enter:
python feelgoodapp.py

Make sure you run requirements.txt beforehand!
(The file requirements.txt was generated using:
pip freeze > requirements.txt)

Please note the following:
1. To see the site go to LOCALHOST:5000/     and NOT 127.0.0.1:5000/
The reason for this is that we had to specify a domain (here localhost)
to use the Facebook API.
2. The first page will allow you to log into Facebook.
3. IMPORTANT:
Please make sure you accept the invitation we sent you on Facebook to be 
added to the developers so that Facebook allows you to visualize the website.

## APIs used:
1. Facebook API
2. Youtube API
3. Giphy API
4. Spotify API
5. Yelp API
6. Google Map API

## Database
We used SQLlite3 for the quotes.
Reason: We could have added a question in the form to select quotes depending
on their main theme

## Link Shortener
The link shortener comes from Proj1.

## Form and Form Validation
We used javascript to validate the form.

## Front end
We used materializecss framework for the interface design, and used animate.css
to animate text.

## Visualization
D3js library

of happiness in a database.
